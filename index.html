            <p> 
            I'm interested in a lot of stuff. Most of all, though, I'm interested in <em>exploration</em>. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            To me, exploration means actively experiencing new situations to determine my interest in them. This past weekend my friends Jonah, Bryson and I went to a fun place that did games that were like real world video games. It was loads of fun. Through this habit of intentional exploration, I have discovered that I enjoy:

            <ul> 
              <li>reading </li> 
              <li>cycling</li>
              <li>jogging around my neighborhood</li>

              <li>and philosophy.</li>
            </ul> 

            I'm also always wanting to extend this list, so if you have any ideas you'd like to hear my expericence with, let me know. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="fears"> Fears </h3>
            <p> Yes, I am afraid of things. I'm not going to pretend like I'm not. In part, I like exploration so I can conquer my fears. A likely incomprehensive list follows: 
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Heights- I falter with this one. I can do heights. For example, I enjoy roller coasters a lot. Whenver I am at any large height, though, I get an overwhelming sense of dread and fear.</li>
                <li> Insects- Insects fascinate me. But only from a distance. If I feel like they are going to touch me I get another overwhelming sense of nervousness. I can trap them, but I feel no desire to touch them. I do not know why I feel afraid of insects. </li>
                <li> Embarrassing Myself- I often stop myself from getting involved in conversations with people I do not know because I am afraid that I will embarass myself. This actually hurts me significantly. </li>

	    <h2> Possibly senseless meanderings </h2>
		<h3>2/8/2023</h3>
		<p> You ever just have an emotion and not know how to describe it? I'm too caught up on making this entry "better" than the last. Writing can't be compared, just do what works best for you. Sometimes you don't acheive your goals, and that's okay too. Life goes on and time heals all wounds.
		  <h3>2/7/2023</h3>
		  <p>When I say "I don't know what to write right now," you might ask yourself "why write anything at all, then?" I think that's a valid question, and my answer is that I want to. If you look around on this website, somehwere you will find that one of my favorite books is <em>Atomic Habits</em>, by James Clear. While I may not have something profound to say at the moment, I want to be able, willing, and excited to write when I might have something profound to say. In <em>Atomic Habits</em>, James Clear gives scientific evidence behind practices which lead to good habits. Further, he explains that good habits are how difference-makers make a difference. For example, if I'm a runner and I'm not feeling especially fast on a certain day, to be a good runner, I must still run that day. I'll still run, even if it's slow, because I want to be a good runner. Writing is something I do. Usually it's on a personal scale, but I'd like to build the habit of sharing my thoughts. I've found that some thoughts that come to mind I really want to share; a platform like this is where I can accomplish that. You may ask why I don't write a book to share my thoughts, and what I can say is that writing a short blog each day provides different benefits than writing a book, especially for sharing ideas. Just like anyone who is literate, I could write a book, but a book is for one specific idea covered in depth. A website is for sharing ideas about nothing in particular, just whatever happens to be on the mind that day. Other ideas that come to my mind, I really want to reflect on internally, that's where I journal. With journaling, too, I make a habit to write most days, even if I don't have much to say. I find that once I start to write, something always comes to mind. The moral of the story is this: I don't have much to say, and for some of the more recent posts, you'll see me say that. I do, however, have a desire to become a better writer <em>and</em> thinker. So, even if I have nothing to say, I write. This is because if I write every day, I will have the evidence to tell myself that I enjoy writing (which I do) and I'm committed to writing (which I am). If I enjoy writing and I'm committed to writing, writing becomes easier and I can do it more often, which is the only way to get better; as the proverb goes: "practice makes perfect". In the act of writing, I am also thinking. So, by practicing writing, I am practicing thinking and thus am becoming both a better writer and thinker. So, if you read any of these where I say "I don't have much to say right now," or anything of the like and ask "why," my answer is that it makes me a better writer and a better thinker. <br>
			If there's anything that you want to get better at, you could use this exact same technique. One line from <em>Atomic Habits</em> that has stuck with me is that some of the greatest in their field are described as capable in still doing whatever it is they're great at, even when they are bored with it. So, for a painter, rather than being naturally gifted or hard working, it is likely that Picasso spent time every day for 60 years to become the name he is today, and at least in part, that is why we know his name. The capability to stay consistent when life gets you down is one of the most important factors in getting better at the things you want to get better at. As an added bonus, as opposed to natural talent or a rigorous work ethic, consistentcy is something that you can actually control. As they say, Rome wasn't built in a day, but it ended up as a formidable city, one that dwarves many towns even today. Lkewise, self-fulfillment will not be attained in a day, or a month, or a year, or even a decade, but only over the course of a lifetime. In my opinion, and one way that I have found helps me to feel fulfilled is through the path of small, consistent efforts applied every day, though long and arduous, it helps me to feel good in the now becuas eI feel that I am setting myself up for later. So, as an example to try and solidify what I'm saying, let's say that you are a runner. You haven't been out in a while. Nonetheless, you have a goal of running a 5K. To accomplish this goal, the only thing you must do is make an effort <em>right now</em> to beat where you were 30 seconds ago. To run the 5K, put on your shoes and stand up. If you have done that, you have improved your position and can now sit down and take off your shoes. Of course, though, tomorrow, if you put on your shoes and stand up, you won't have made any further proress towards your goal of running a 5K. In your own judgement, complete a gal tomorrow which exceeds what you did today, no matter how small the jump. If you continue like this, beating the effort that you gave yesterday, even by 1%, in one week's time you will have improved monumentally from where you started, and you will have gained momentum towards your goal of running a 5K. With a consistent effort, you can run that 5K before you know it. As this topic shouldn't be avoided, bad days <em>do</em> happen. <em>That's okay</em>, don't get down on yourself, push through it; all you need is a tiny effort more than the day before. Tell yourself: "if I gave x units of effort 1 day ago, I can give x+0.1 units of effort today." <br>
			One problem I run into when it comes to habit builing is that there are so many ways to improve myself that I don't know how to move forward with any of them, so I do one of two things: a) I try to do them all and burn myself out quickly or b) I don't choose any and make no progress towards any of my goals. Here's one thing I have learned as I've tried building good habits: you can only do one thing at a time. Everyone is naturally ambitious, we all have within us massive amounts of potential, and so it is easy to see that we can attain whatever we want, if we set our mind towards our goals. Unfortunately, this can lead to us setting too many goals and metaphorically "burning the candle at both ends," as they say. In my recent experience, it is best to choose one singular goal and work on that until you feel comfortable, and then once you get comfortable you can tack on some other ambitions. Cooking has provided a valuable lesson for me: you can always make more, but you cannot make less. If you want to educate yourself, read <em>ONE</em> book. If you want to become a better cook, make <em>ONE</em> recipe. If you want to become a better mechanic, start with <em>ONE</em> project. One key morsel about consistency is self-restraint. Some days you're going to feel like you can do a thousand things at once. What's important to realize, if you want to make progress towards some goal, is that you need to set a goal that you can ALWAYS accomplish, no matter the day so that you never stop being consistent. Sometimes you may exceed that goal, sometimes you may just meet it, but as long as the goal is met, you've accomplished what you set out to do and you can't ask for anything more than that. There are zero ambitions not yet realized that are greater than any complete task. It doesn't matter if your goal is to draw one straight one in a mural, if you complete that goal, you have done more than someone who aspires to win the Nobel prize but has not yet done so. If you're working towards a goal, there are two things to keep in mind: a) you want to make sure that you can improve upon what you did yesterday (so, be aware of how much effort you're putting in today) b) you want to make sure that you have a goal that you can meet every single day, no matter how you're feeling. Whichever one of the two is more important to you is up to you. Progress is made with both of them. I've now set the expectation for myself to top this tomorrow, so wish me luck. Good luck with your goal-achieving!

		  <p>It's a battle against laziness right now, I'm not sure what's up. If you're feeling unmotivated now you're not alone. We can get through this feeling together, it just takes one step at a time.</p>
		  <?php echo "<h3>2/5/2023</h3>"; ?>
		  <p> I'm getting to closer to being able to understand enough PHP to get up the feedback form. I'm pretty excited to get it up and running. I make sure to limit how much I do per day though, so I don't burn myself out and it's easy to do everyday. Consistency is key, so I need to be conducive to that. Feedback form is coming soon, though! Believe it.
		  <h3>2/4/2023</h3>
		  <p>Again, I don't have much to say right now but I'm writing this to get back into the habit of updating my website consistently. Today for me has been alright, but living alone can come with its downsides. As you could probably guess, it gets lonely. For my personal taste, solitude is typically welcome, but even so I do like getting together with friends in a non-work environment every now and again. One thing that's hard for me when I get into states of loneliness is reaching out to other people to try and cure my loneliness. Loneliness can suck the energy right out, but I've found that the best way to combat it is to <em>get together</em> with <em>anybody</em> so that you're not alone. It probably shouldn't be expected to <em>always</em> be able to cure feelings of loneliness, but making any sort of move to get together with someone that you haven't seen in a while or even wouldn't usually see yourself hanging out with is better than sitting and sulking in loneliness, for me, that is. It's easy to hop onto social media to try and find some sort of social connection, but that simply doesn't do the trick. Social media functions differently than it once did; when I was younger, it was a way to connect with friends outside of school. Today, though, I would argue that social media is mostly a business tool. The best way get out of a slump of loneliness is to get off of your phone and get together, in-person, with someone else. You may read this and say "I don't have anyone to talk to," or "I don't have any friends". I understand that feeling, but as Mitch Albom put it best: "the only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone." Loneliness is a tricky emotion, and like everything I'll say, there likely isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to helping it. Getting off of your phone and together with somebody (who you may not even know that well) is way easier said than done, but the truth is, if you want to stop feeling lonely, you're going to have to make that effort to broaden your horizons and see past what's directly in front of you. The fact of the matter is that many people are feeling lonelier than ever, but if we spend time thinking that we are alone we're wasting it. Loneliness can be compared to being on an island; on a normal day, the land is fruitful and you can benefit greatly from all which surrounds you. However, every now and again the land on which you are so comfortable is no longer fruitful and needs time to regenerate. At this moment, you need to make a choice: you can stay on the island to die there or you can get in the water to find another island. We can think that the fruit will return to the island one day and wait around for a morsel of food while being able to do nothing to increase the speed of the regrowth, or we can take action to find another island that will satisfy our necessities to live. If we sit around thinking about our bad luck we won't understand how lucky we are to be given the opportunity to get off of the island. Loneliness can feel sad and it can make you really hurt, but, if we can take action against loneliness we may find an island that has even better food than the first one, and that is quite the opportunity. If it isn't clear, my point is this: loneliness is a difficult feeling to overcome, but there's a way around it. The emotion can't be entirely prevented, but it can be remedied. To remedy loneliness, it is necessary to make an effort. Two reasons to make that effort are as follows: 1) making the effort can stop you from feeling lonely, which I assume is a mostly negative feeling that most people want to get rid of, and, 2) thinking we are alone, which I'm equating with loneliness, is a waste of time. In my opinion, this is the most valuable resource that we humans have access to and should try to prevent wasting any of it. Though, waste happens and if there is a time where you feel as if you've wasted time, it's okay. You should just try to move on instead of feeling bad about it. In conclusion, with effort (maybe big, maybe small), it is possible to see that we are not alone. We are never <em>truly</em> alone unless we make ourselves to be that way. 
		  <h3>2/3/2023</h3>
		  <p>Today was a sluggish one, I do not necessarily feel like I have taken a step back or anything, but I spent a lot of time on my phone and that kind of just wiped my brain of it energy. It was definitely my own choice to do so, but I regret it. What's important, though, is not to get caught up worrying about what I can't change. I need to know that it didn't feel good to spend so much time on my phone, but only so that I don't do it in the future and not so that I can berate myself for feeling like I wasted time. I didn't really waste time, but I could have been more constructive. To remedy such a feeling I've tried to use what little time I hav left in the day to feel productive. For me, my feeling of productivty is closely linked to my feeling of self worth. My time here is limited so I don't want to waste any of it and productivity is really just a word that means I did something I valued with my time, even though it wasn't necessarily easy. It's surprising how difficult it is sometimes to be productive. It would make sense that I value something so I want to keep doing it, but there's an intial hump to get over which makes it an obstacle to be productive. Perhaps that why being productive is so gratifying- you've overcome an obstacle due to your own merit. Those are the sort of small victories to celebrate, and today I'm going to celebrate submitting this post.

		  <p>I have a soccer game later today (at 10 PM!!). I've struggled with meeting people in any other way. When I go to play soccer, though, I want to play soccer, so I'm not always the most endearing and charismatic that I could be. I'm pretty competitive and I really love the game, so I don't necessarily want to impede my focus (as ridiculous as that may sound I promise that it's true) by going just to make friends. Luckily, though, soccer is a social envronment where you don't have to be buddy-buddy all of the time. You don't even really have to talk to someone to feel a connection with them. My first game of the season I scored a goal and the guy that assisted me gave me a beautiful backheel and set me up for possibly the easiest goal of my life. I didn't even know his name at the time, but he was my best friend for the rest of the game and now we chtichat before every game together. While you may not love soccer or sports, there is a community for just about everything that you might like to do. To get maximal enjoyment out of meeting people, I would suggest doing something that you would be content doing on your own, but with others. Unfortunately, I don't think there exists a one-size-fits-all way/place to meet new people that will ever be as good as school, especially as you get older. A common suggestion I hear is to go to bars, but for me, I flounder in those settings. I don't know if it's the loud music, the amount of people present, the fact that many people arrive and stay within a group, or some other factor(s), but the bar just doesn't work for me. So, I've had to explore new avenues to meet people. For me, soccer is a way to meet people, but maybe you like another activity, say meditation. A yoga studio or a spiritual center probably has classes on meditation and therefore may be a place to go to practice what you already like doing, while around other people. In general, here's my attempt to show you how to meet new people (if you ever need it): 
			  <ol>
				  <li>#1. Identify an activity that you really like to do on your own, sometimes that may be a no-brainer, other times it may require some thought.</li>
				  <li>#2. Browse local listings online, in the newspaper, posted in buildings, or broadcasted by people you know to find a community that practices that activity </li>
				  <li>#3. Find a way to get involved with that community. (You may have to spend money sometimes; you're just going to have to get over that part)</li>
				  <li>#4. This part is very important: <em>Take action</em> to enact that way to get involved <em>and follow through</em> with it until the end.</li>
		          </ol>

		  <p>Today has been one of those days where I feel like I'm on the precipe of a solution but not quite there yet. I've been studying the foundations of mathematics a little bit lately and that's led me to the contemplation of infinity. It's a real mind stumper, that one. It's occupied my mind all day but I've yet to consciously come to any sort of satisfying conclusion regarding any aspect of infinity. Again, I feel lost. What do you do when you're lost? Well, I know what I do: sulk. Then, after I'm done, I try to move past it. It's demotivating to feel lost, but the only way to improve is to keep moving forward. As Robert Frost put it: "the best way out is always through". When you're lost, the only way you're going to get out of being lost is to just feel lost for a little while (or even a lotta while). One of the weird parts of being human is that sometimes the best move is not to employ your rational faculties, but instead to let your experience move along its due course while restraining all desire to change anything. That's one thing I do a lot: try to change things. I've yet to find the balance between active decision making and passive experiencing. If that confuses you it's because it's hard for me to articulate exactly what I mean. I'll phrase it like this: I believe that a human has the capacity to impact the course of events in their life. For example, if someone wants to become a better cook they can cook more often. However, I do not believe that all events in a human's life can be controlled. This is where I have not found the balance. I do not know what aspects of my life I have control over and what aspects of my life I do not have control over. In reponse, I attempt to control every aspect of my life, which, if you've ever tried to do, you know, is rather impossible. So, at this point I'm writing more to myself than to whomever might be reading this, but if what I'm writing speaks to you, by all means- use it (as the proverb goes: if the shoe fits, wear it). If you're lost or feeling like you have lost control of your life, do your best to not fight it. This too, is easier said than done. Get away from the feeling, stop thinking about whatever is making you feel lost and move on with your life. Clarity comes when you least expect it, so if you're constantly hoping for clarity it will never come. Let go to save yourself from unnecessary negative feelings. I understand and feel the urge myself to push for any answers to life's most probing questions, but a life spent on one task will surely end in peril. If you never paid attention to your peripheral vision you'd see but a fraction of what the world has to offer you. Walk outside, ride your bike, draw a picture, read a book, stay away from your phone, and get out of your mind. Debate all you want about the existence of the world outside of your mind and the validity of the experiences that it gives you, but the only way you can know it is to experience it. Remember, this life, though it can end before you know it, isn't a sprint. Rome wasn't built in a day and if you don't have all the answers when you die, you'll be dead, so why should it matter? This life is temporary and it shouldn't be spent in hopeless dejection, especially if that's a feeling which comes from the pursuit which brings you the most joy. 
		  <h3>1/31/2023</h3>
		  <p>Let me tell you all, PHP is not very easy to understand. I'm getting there though. I think partially stopped coding because I started that language and found out that it isn't as easy as HTML. That's probably not fully the reason, but probably at least part of it. I wonder, does anyone feel like they can never definitively know if something they did caused something else? I'm being a little loose with my language here because I know that if I bend a glass thermometer and it breaks it's because o the force that I applied to it. However, is that the ONLY reason that it broke? Could it have broken because of a manufacturing defect instead? Cause and effect seem so clear at the surface, but when you think about anything long enough it gets cloudy. That leads me into another thought that has been occuppying my brain, is thought a virtue, a hindrance, or a little of both? Of course, it depends on how "thought" is defined, but then again how do you define ANYTHING? Even something as clear as a number is hard to define. What allows me to say that 3 and 4 or 0.1 and 139047 are all numbers? Thoughts beget questions and questions being desire. If desire being fulfilled is good, then thought is good, if desire being fulfilled is bad, then thought it bad. Then that begs further quandries: what if desire being fulfilled is neither good nor bad but somewhere in between? Also, if desire being fulfilled is fully good or fully bad, what about the instances where desire can't be fulfilled, what does that then imply about the nature of thought? We humans are intelligent; that I believe. Can all these questions be answered? That is yet to be determined from my underlying assumption. Can we imagine something that does not exist? If so, does our thinking of it make it exist? I have no idea where to even start. A nasty case of choice paralysis it seems. Until next time.
		  <h3>1/30/2023</h3>
		  <p>I'm just writing this so that I can get back in the habit of updating this website. I need to hop back on coding too, I've been pretty focused on only doing what I want to do and now that I have a job complacency has started to set in, so I care less than I did before about improving myself in some ways. It's a shame, really, but my interests (as I'm sure everyon else's are) shift constantly. Consistency is key to mastering any skill, and web design is a cool skill that I would eventually like to master, whether I'll use it in a job setting or not. So, it's time to hop back on the horse. </p>
		  <h3>1/29/2023</h3>
		  <p> Okay, so a little over a month has passed (past?) since I last updated this website, if you can read, you'll know that. A friend of mine, Joseph, reached out to me to keep me accountable for this, which I respect. Moving to a new area has brought with it a whole host of emotions. If I didn't say it in my last 'meandering,' I moved up here on January 1st. I started a "new year in a new abode" as my property manager told me. So, for almost a month now I've been experimenting non-stop. I've found that I enjoy <em>baking</em> (who would've guessed?), meditation, and Plato's philosophy (Dr. Gendreau would be proud), though I'm looking to branch out to some Eastern philosophy too so that I don't get too caught up in one type of thought. Living alone has been pleasant. I am responsible for cleaning up after myself, paying for (almost) all of my needs, and solving all of the problems that come to me. This can be a hassle at times, like two weeks ago I went out in Indianapolis and illegally paked and got my car towed. I spent $300 to get my car back and a significant portion of a Sunday as well. That was a bit of a fiasco to be honest. I've made a few friends from work, but the company that I work for is pretty small so there aren't a ton of people to meet and I haven't hung out with any of them outside of work yet. I was supposed to go snowboarding with a friend, Dylan, today, but the weather was not good for it. I wasn't too mad because I've never gone snowboarding and I would've had to drive an hour and a half there and back (I like to lounge and relax on Sundays). For the most part, my weekends consist of doing a few things: 1) trying to think of new ways to connect with people my age, 2) reading, 3) sleeping, 4) doing chores, 5) staring at the ceiling, and 6) cooking/baking. While I do enjoy the solitude and the lack of responsibility to anyone aside from myself, living alone can be very boring. This is especially true when you don't have many friends to hang out with. If you do ever live on your own in a similar situation to me though, I do have at least one tip: be patient. Like everything in life, living alone often will not unfold as you expect it. A month without anything but yourself and your work to entertain you can feel like forever when you're in the thick of it, but time proceeds slowly and quickly at the same time. If you're patient, you'll be okay with the way that things are going and you'll learn to be satisfied with what you have and nothing more. That can be a valuable tool to have in your toolbox when acquiring more than what you have just simply isn't an option. This is one aspect of my character that I am consistently having to work on. I'm very impatient so I find myself wanting more than I'm able to have right now. I find myself thinking that Rome should be able to be built in a day, but it can't and it never will be. So, if you ever live alone and you want advice; be patient and learn what YOU like to do. You might say that you like meeting and talking to other people, but sometimes that just isn't an option. So, instead of looking for your own satisfaction in others, figure out what is something that you would like to do by yourself. It's easier said than done and I'm still working on finding that out for myself, but I am more comfortable being alone with nothing to do now than I was 8 months ago. Maybe that's a part of growing up, but learning more about your own preferences, I find, can be helpful for living alone. 
		  <h3>12/28/2022</h3>
		  <p> Well, I may have gotten a place to stay. That's a postiive. I was gone looking for one for the last two days. It was exciting at first, but it got very tiring. I keep thinking about how I will really be moving somewhere away from home for a job. It's always felt like I've wanted to do it but it's a little more nerve-wracking when dream becomes reality. That's part of being a good employee and adult, though; when push comes to shove, you need to seize the opportunity. Nervousness inflicts everyone. Though, I feel that the great use that nervous energy to propel them into their version of success. Pushing past the nervous energy is not an easy task for anyone that I know. We spend our lives creating comfort zones and we feel reluctant to leave them. I know that I do at least. For me, though, I want to explore new opportunities. The only way to do that, as I see it, is to force myself to do the things I'm nervous doing: going up and talking to new people, being demanding with my work life, saying "yes" <em>AND</em> saying "no". In reality (I can't really say if this is true for everyone), I know that I don't really have much to lose, and as long as I'm not neglecting my responsibilities, nothing can damage me. So, (perhaps the most difficult part of my life) I have to take this knowledge ad put it into action if I want to succeed. And you can do the same thing to see if getting out of your comfort zone makes you feel more successful. I've been trying to incorporate a new way of living into my day-to-day: if there's something that I don't want to do, I'm going to force myself to do it anyways. I see that the majority of time, for me, I don't want to do something because I'm letting my emotions dictate my behavior. That can mean that I'm "too tired" to do something, I'm afraid of what someone else will think of my actions, I'm  caught up in my pettiness towards someone's past actions, and more. I find that overcoming these mental barriers and forcing action allows me more opportuities for failure and success. I hear often that the fear of failure is the biggest opponent to success. While I am also afraid to fail, I strive for failure, because as so many people before me have put it: failure is a great way to learn. And I love to learn. Without action, though, it is difficult to fail, and learning is reduced to abstractions only applicable in theory to my daily life. Failing can be hard, but I do believe that time heals all wounds, and when one door closes aother door opens. To be clear, I think that failure- while mostly negative in the short term- is only temporary. In the long term, failure can be abundantly beneficial; that is, if you learn from it. 
		  <h3>12/26/2022</h3>
		  <p> Eventually, this website is going to look pretty. I started learning PHP today. I have an answer for the astrophysics problem but I have no way of confirming its corrrect-ness. I started reviewing how batteries work last night for some odd reason, sometimes I get these weird compulsions to do things, like review how a chemical battery works. I woke up to go to work today and no one was there. So, I tried to find a way in and I didn't so I just left. It was a nice little gift. Anyways, I just wante to update this website so that I can stay in the habit of maintaining it. 
		  <h3>12/23/2022</h3>
		  <p> Alright, so I just figured out that I need another programming language to be able to actually view the data from the feedback form (kind of inconvenient, but good to know). So, that will be delayed until I learn PHP. I was planning on learning CSS next, but I would like to get the feedback form up ASAP, and so I will likely go ahead and start learning PHP once I'm finished learning the basics of HTML. Also, I've been thinking about how to solve an astrophysics problem today. I'm trying to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of a 1 meter telescope with the knowledge that it has a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) detector and the signal is of a star of radius <em>R</em>. There's a bit more information too, but I'm trying to determine what a signal is right now. I feel that will help me to solve this problem. When I figure it out I will update the site.
		  <h3>12/22/2022</h3>
		  <p> Today I had to reschedule my apartment viewing appointments because of the weather. Honestly, that was okay with me; now I have errands to run tomorrow but once those are done I can spend more time on my hobbies. I also accepted the offer with a $4,000/yr pay raise. You should just ask if you're offered a job and you want more money. The absolute worst thing that can happen is that your employers say no. 
		  <h3>12/21/2022</h3>
		  <p>I'm headed to look for an apartment tomorrow after I get out of work. I'm scheduled to look at 4 of them and I'm not exactly sure if there's something in particular I should look for. Anyways, it's up to me now. I wish I could ask for your all's opinion but I haven't figured out the feedback form yet. Today I've been formatting my code because it needs to be formatted before it gets too outrageously long. Also, I had a little bit of a eureka moment yesterday. I'm doing some problems in the astrophysics book from further up (Dan Maoz's) to understand what kind of problems could arise in an astrophysics setting (I think that's ultimately what I want to end up doing) and one of the problems asked to find the angular size of the Sun, Jupiter, and a Sun-like star that's 10 light years away. The words "angular size" made me think that I needed to find the circumference and that was the angular size but it ended up that it was much easier than I thought it'd be (that happens quite often). "Angular size" just means using the distance and the diameter of the bodies to set up a rght triangle and find the size of the angle directly opposite of the body that you're interested in and voila, angular size, found. It felt nice to figure that one out.
		  <h3> 12/20/2022</h3>
		  <p> I've started experimenting with forms for the feedback form. I'm not exactly sure how the data get stored yet so hopefully that information will come soon. For now, we're still without a feedback form. I asked for a raise on my offer letter today with no response. I quit all three of my jobs. I told my friends I'm moving. I've scheduled appointments for apartment viewings but finding a place to live isn't exactly as easy as 1-2-3. There are so many factors to consider. Anyways, I'm happy about my current situation. I discovered that there's an indoor soccer arena not far from where I'm looking to live so I'm going to register for the next session soon. That's all for now. 
		  <h3>12/19/2022</h3>
		  <p>So, today I got the job offer that I was waiting for...awesome! Yet again, though, these types of decisions are hard to make. Accepting this job offer would mean that I have to find an apartment in a completely new state within two weeks time. Okay, that's doable, but it also means that I have to leave my friends who I've gotten so close to as of late, and there's still the question of what happens if I get accepted into graduate school. I had a phone call with a professor at a school that I applied to who said my GRE scores were good (I did not think they were) so...double awesome. Right now, I'm thinking that the best option for me is to take the job. It's a big step towards testing my future aspirations and it'll allow me the opportunity for exploration. If I get accepted into graduate school 3 or 4 months down the road and I like the job I can ask to see about deferring my admission to the Spring semester so that I can fulfill my contract or just staying in the job. If I don't like the job, I can ask about moving my admission up to a Summer start date and leaving once that starts, or I can talk to my bosses about leaving in August and see what they think. The only problem I see is the lease on an apartment, but there are always sub-leases, so worst-case scenario I can figure out that situation. Any way this is put, I think that accepting the job offer is a good move. It's rational, it gives me a look into a prospective career, and it allows me to explore a new city in a new state. I'll miss my friends, but they've told me that I need to do what's best for me and they'll still be my friends no matter where I go, so that feels good to hear. Just to give anyone who reads this some context, I've been out of school for 7 months now and this is the first job offer that I feel has been in my field. It's taken a lot of consistent practice to get where I am now. I'll continue to update this website as the Carter Chronicles unfold. 
		  <h3>12/18/2022</h3>
		  <p>I've found goal-setting to be a positive and negative aspect for accomplishing goals. You see, goals are difficult to set for me because I feel that the future is unpredictable. I have and still attempt to set goals, but if they are any longer than a week or so it's difficult for me to accomplish them. I chatted with my friend Bryson while on a run today and I'm in a somewhat sticky situation. I currently have three goals: #1 move out of my parents' house, #2 attend and complete graduate school, and #3 get a job that pays good money. To the untrained eye it may seem like I <em>do</em> have specific long-term goals, but to my eyes there's one problem. Making moves towards any one of these goals postpones completion of the others. My friends, I have been caught by a case of choice paralysis. This feels like one of those moments where the best move is just to dive right into the deep end and learn from my mistakes as I go, but I'm biding my time to see if I can come up with a better option. One thing I've learned from playing chess with my friends, though, is that if you bide your time for too long, you lose your chance (and the game). Check back in after a few days' time to see how the Chronicles of Carter Alvey play out...
		  <h3>12/17/2022</h3>
		  <p> Today I was a host at the pizza joint where I work. To be honest, the restaurant business isn't really my favorite industry, but I have a decent amount of experience with it and serving can earn you some pretty good change. This place is not exactly like what I've done in the past, but the job is easy enough and it's good for a temporary gig. For me, while I'm looking for a career I'm looking at a few things: #1: I'm trying to determine whether or not I enjoy solving the problems that arise in that job. I've stopped looking for a job that doesn't have any problems; if those do exist, they are rare. #2: I look for whether the job utilizes my strengths enough. For example, I would consider myself to be a versatile employee, so if I'm in a position where I'm not able to use my versatility, such as in my park janitor job, I find a lack of fulfillment. There are other factors  that I consider, like who will I be working with, where is the job located, are there opportunities for advancement within the company, and more. Though, to start this out, and to keep this entry brief, I look for two things in a career: 1) Do I like solving the problems? 2) Are my strengths being utilized? 
		  <h3>12/16/2022</h3>
		  <p>I'm thinking of different ideas for what to do with thi website. My dad suggested that I report on science news because I really like science. I thought that would be fun for a while but I'd also like to do other stuff. I don't know if I want this to be a blog, but keeping trak of my journey in this could be fun. Another thing that was suggested to me by my friend Jonah is to catalog my career journey. I've had a somewhat difficult time figuring out what it is I want to do with my life and I think that could be valuable for anyone else who is struggling to figure out their life's purpose. Right now I am waiting to hear back on whether or not I will be offered a job from a start up near Indianapolis. I've found one of the best ways for me to figure out what I like is just to take action to try have as many experiences as I can and figure out what I like from there. Step one in finding your life's purpose: figure out what you like and what you do not like.
		  <h3> 12/15/2022</h3> 
		  <p> Yes! I finally got my website to publish. Now, all I need to do is figure out how to get my photos to show up and I'll be up and running. I can't believe I got it to work. Let's go!
            <h3>12/13/2022 </h3>
		<p> I'm going to keep this one brief. I tried publishing my website publically today. It took too much effort for today. I want this to be a fun project, so I decided to stop. Soon, I will figure it out. Soon, I plan to learn about CSS. Just HTML works for now. I'm also going to start taking more pictures for this, I think.
	    <h3> 12/12/2022 </h3>
		<p> Well, I'm testing out this whole writing on the internet thing. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. I'm searching for a job and I recently was offered one. I want a different one that I recently got an interview for, but I havent gotten a job offer from them yet. That feels like an extremely entitled thing to say. Today, I rejected my first job offer. Only time will tell how that decision will work out. This doesn't work as well as I thought it would. I'm not really sure what all to add to this site either. It's just fun to try out all kinds of different stuff.</p>
