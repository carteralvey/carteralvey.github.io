            <p> 
            I'm interested in a lot of stuff. Most of all, though, I'm interested in <em>exploration</em>. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            To me, exploration means actively experiencing new situations to determine my interest in them. This past weekend I went to an amateur Muay Thai fighting arena with a close friend of mine, Bryson. I have discovered that I enjoy:

            <ul> 
              <li>reading </li> 
              <li>cycling</li>
              <li>jogging around my neighborhood</li> 
              <li>playing sports </li>
                <ul>
                  <li> soccer </li>
                  <li> basketball </li>
                  <li> team handball </li>
                </ul> 
              <li>chess </li> 
              <li>hiking (in small doses)</li> 
              <li>photography</li> 
              <li>writing</li>
              <li>computer programming </li> 
              <li>learning new languages</li> 
              <li>spending time with my family </li>
              <li>cooking</li>
              <li>record keeping</li> 
              <li>Self reflection and guided reflection </li>
              <li> speculative discussion </li>
              <li> roller coasters/theme parks </li>
              <li>science</li>
              <li>religion</li>
              <li> and philosophy.</li>
            </ul> 

            I'm also always wanting to extend this list, so if you have any ideas, you'd like to hear my expericence with, let me know. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="fears"> Fears </h3>
            <p> Yes, I am afraid of things. I'm not going to pretend like I'm not. In part, I like exploration so I can conquer my fears. A likely incomprehensive list follows: 
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Heights- I falter with this one. I can do heights. For example, I enjoy roller coasters a lot. Whenver I am at any large height, though, I get an overwhelming sense of dread and fear.</li>
                <li> Insects- Insects fascinate me. But only from a distance. If I feel like they are going to touch me I get another overwhelming sense of nervousness. I can trap them, but I feel no desire to touch them. I do not know why I feel afraid of insects. </li>
                <li> Embarrassing Myself- I often stop myself from getting involved in conversations with people I do not know because I am afraid that I will embarass myself. This actually hurts me significantly. </li>
              
              </ul>
            <h3 id="past_jobs"> Jobs I have had </h3>
            <ul> 
              <li> dishwasher </li>

              <li>groundskeeper</li>
              <li>server</li>
              <li>high school teacher</li>

		  <h3> 12/15/2022</h3> 
		  <p> Yes! I finally got my website to publish. Now, all I need to do is figure out how to get my photos to show up and I'll be up and running. I can't believe I got it to work. Let's go!
            <h3>12/13/2022 </h3>
		<p> I'm going to keep this one brief. I tried publishing my website publically today. It took too much effort for today. I want this to be a fun project, so I decided to stop. Soon, I will figure it out. Soon, I plan to learn about CSS. Just HTML works for now. I'm also going to start taking more pictures for this, I think.
	    <h3> 12/12/2022 </h3>
		<p> Well, I'm testing out this whole writing on the internet thing. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. I'm searching for a job and I recently was offered one. I want a different one that I recently got an interview for, but I havent gotten a job offer from them yet. That feels like an extremely entitled thing to say. Today, I rejected my first job offer. Only time will tell how that decision will work out. This doesn't work as well as I thought it would. I'm not really sure what all to add to this site either. It's just fun to try out all kinds of different stuff.</p>
