            <p> 
            I'm interested in a lot of stuff. Most of all, though, I'm interested in <em>exploration</em>. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            To me, exploration means actively experiencing new situations to determine my interest in them. This past weekend my friends Jonah, Bryson and I went to a fun place that did games that were like real world video games. It was loads of fun. Through this habit of intentional exploration, I have discovered that I enjoy:

            <ul> 
              <li>reading </li> 
              <li>cycling</li>
              <li>jogging around my neighborhood</li> 
              <li>playing sports </li>
                <ul>
                  <li> soccer </li>
                  <li> basketball </li>
                  <li> team handball </li>
                </ul> 
              <li>chess </li> 
              <li>hiking (in small doses)</li> 
              <li>photography</li> 
              <li>writing</li>
              <li>computer programming </li> 
              <li>learning new languages</li> 
	      <li>Team building games with my close friends</li>
              <li>spending time with my family </li>
              <li>cooking</li>
              <li>record keeping</li> 
              <li>Self reflection and guided reflection </li>
              <li> speculative discussion </li>
              <li> roller coasters/theme parks </li>
              <li>science</li>
              <li>religion</li>
              <li> and philosophy.</li>
            </ul> 

            I'm also always wanting to extend this list, so if you have any ideas, you'd like to hear my expericence with, let me know. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="fears"> Fears </h3>
            <p> Yes, I am afraid of things. I'm not going to pretend like I'm not. In part, I like exploration so I can conquer my fears. A likely incomprehensive list follows: 
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Heights- I falter with this one. I can do heights. For example, I enjoy roller coasters a lot. Whenver I am at any large height, though, I get an overwhelming sense of dread and fear.</li>
                <li> Insects- Insects fascinate me. But only from a distance. If I feel like they are going to touch me I get another overwhelming sense of nervousness. I can trap them, but I feel no desire to touch them. I do not know why I feel afraid of insects. </li>
                <li> Embarrassing Myself- I often stop myself from getting involved in conversations with people I do not know because I am afraid that I will embarass myself. This actually hurts me significantly. </li>
              
              </ul>
            <h3 id="past_jobs"> Jobs I have had </h3>

	    <h2> Possibly senseless meanderings </h2>
		  <h3>12/26/2022</h3>
		  <p> Eventually, this website is going to look pretty. I started learning PHP today. I have an answer for the astrophysics problem but I have no way of confirming its corrrect-ness. I started reviewing how batteries work last night for some odd reason, sometimes I get these weird compulsions to do things, like review how a chemical battery works. I woke up to go to work today and no one was there. So, I tried to find a way in and I didn't so I just left. It was a nice little gift. Anyways, I just wante to update this website so that I can stay in the habit of maintaining it. 
		  <h3>12/23/2022</h3>
		  <p> Alright, so I just figured out that I need another programming language to be able to actually view the data from the feedback form (kind of inconvenient, but good to know). So, that will be delayed until I learn PHP. I was planning on learning CSS next, but I would like to get the feedback form up ASAP, and so I will likely go ahead and start learning PHP once I'm finished learning the basics of HTML. Also, I've been thinking about how to solve an astrophysics problem today. I'm trying to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of a 1 meter telescope with the knowledge that it has a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) detector and the signal is of a star of radius <em>R</em>. There's a bit more information too, but I'm trying to determine what a signal is right now. I feel that will help me to solve this problem. When I figure it out I will update the site.
		  <h3>12/22/2022</h3>
		  <p> Today I had to reschedule my apartment viewing appointments because of the weather. Honestly, that was okay with me; now I have errands to run tomorrow but once those are done I can spend more time on my hobbies. I also accepted the offer with a $4,000/yr pay raise. You should just ask if you're offered a job and you want more money. The absolute worst thing that can happen is that your employers say no. 
		  <h3>12/21/2022</h3>
		  <p>I'm headed to look for an apartment tomorrow after I get out of work. I'm scheduled to look at 4 of them and I'm not exactly sure if there's something in particular I should look for. Anyways, it's up to me now. I wish I could ask for your all's opinion but I haven't figured out the feedback form yet. Today I've been formatting my code because it needs to be formatted before it gets too outrageously long. Also, I had a little bit of a eureka moment yesterday. I'm doing some problems in the astrophysics book from further up (Dan Maoz's) to understand what kind of problems could arise in an astrophysics setting (I think that's ultimately what I want to end up doing) and one of the problems asked to find the angular size of the Sun, Jupiter, and a Sun-like star that's 10 light years away. The words "angular size" made me think that I needed to find the circumference and that was the angular size but it ended up that it was much easier than I thought it'd be (that happens quite often). "Angular size" just means using the distance and the diameter of the bodies to set up a rght triangle and find the size of the angle directly opposite of the body that you're interested in and voila, angular size, found. It felt nice to figure that one out.
		  <h3> 12/20/2022</h3>
		  <p> I've started experimenting with forms for the feedback form. I'm not exactly sure how the data get stored yet so hopefully that information will come soon. For now, we're still without a feedback form. I asked for a raise on my offer letter today with no response. I quit all three of my jobs. I told my friends I'm moving. I've scheduled appointments for apartment viewings but finding a place to live isn't exactly as easy as 1-2-3. There are so many factors to consider. Anyways, I'm happy about my current situation. I discovered that there's an indoor soccer arena not far from where I'm looking to live so I'm going to register for the next session soon. That's all for now. 
		  <h3>12/19/2022</h3>
		  <p>So, today I got the job offer that I was waiting for...awesome! Yet again, though, these types of decisions are hard to make. Accepting this job offer would mean that I have to find an apartment in a completely new state within two weeks time. Okay, that's doable, but it also means that I have to leave my friends who I've gotten so close to as of late, and there's still the question of what happens if I get accepted into graduate school. I had a phone call with a professor at a school that I applied to who said my GRE scores were good (I did not think they were) so...double awesome. Right now, I'm thinking that the best option for me is to take the job. It's a big step towards testing my future aspirations and it'll allow me the opportunity for exploration. If I get accepted into graduate school 3 or 4 months down the road and I like the job I can ask to see about deferring my admission to the Spring semester so that I can fulfill my contract or just staying in the job. If I don't like the job, I can ask about moving my admission up to a Summer start date and leaving once that starts, or I can talk to my bosses about leaving in August and see what they think. The only problem I see is the lease on an apartment, but there are always sub-leases, so worst-case scenario I can figure out that situation. Any way this is put, I think that accepting the job offer is a good move. It's rational, it gives me a look into a prospective career, and it allows me to explore a new city in a new state. I'll miss my friends, but they've told me that I need to do what's best for me and they'll still be my friends no matter where I go, so that feels good to hear. Just to give anyone who reads this some context, I've been out of school for 7 months now and this is the first job offer that I feel has been in my field. It's taken a lot of consistent practice to get where I am now. I'll continue to update this website as the Carter Chronicles unfold. 
		  <h3>12/18/2022</h3>
		  <p>I've found goal-setting to be a positive and negative aspect for accomplishing goals. You see, goals are difficult to set for me because I feel that the future is unpredictable. I have and still attempt to set goals, but if they are any longer than a week or so it's difficult for me to accomplish them. I chatted with my friend Bryson while on a run today and I'm in a somewhat sticky situation. I currently have three goals: #1 move out of my parents' house, #2 attend and complete graduate school, and #3 get a job that pays good money. To the untrained eye it may seem like I <em>do</em> have specific long-term goals, but to my eyes there's one problem. Making moves towards any one of these goals postpones completion of the others. My friends, I have been caught by a case of choice paralysis. This feels like one of those moments where the best move is just to dive right into the deep end and learn from my mistakes as I go, but I'm biding my time to see if I can come up with a better option. One thing I've learned from playing chess with my friends, though, is that if you bide your time for too long, you lose your chance (and the game). Check back in after a few days' time to see how the Chronicles of Carter Alvey play out...
		  <h3>12/17/2022</h3>
		  <p> Today I was a host at the pizza joint where I work. To be honest, the restaurant business isn't really my favorite industry, but I have a decent amount of experience with it and serving can earn you some pretty good change. This place is not exactly like what I've done in the past, but the job is easy enough and it's good for a temporary gig. For me, while I'm looking for a career I'm looking at a few things: #1: I'm trying to determine whether or not I enjoy solving the problems that arise in that job. I've stopped looking for a job that doesn't have any problems; if those do exist, they are rare. #2: I look for whether the job utilizes my strengths enough. For example, I would consider myself to be a versatile employee, so if I'm in a position where I'm not able to use my versatility, such as in my park janitor job, I find a lack of fulfillment. There are other factors  that I consider, like who will I be working with, where is the job located, are there opportunities for advancement within the company, and more. Though, to start this out, and to keep this entry brief, I look for two things in a career: 1) Do I like solving the problems? 2) Are my strengths being utilized? 
		  <h3>12/16/2022</h3>
		  <p>I'm thinking of different ideas for what to do with thi website. My dad suggested that I report on science news because I really like science. I thought that would be fun for a while but I'd also like to do other stuff. I don't know if I want this to be a blog, but keeping trak of my journey in this could be fun. Another thing that was suggested to me by my friend Jonah is to catalog my career journey. I've had a somewhat difficult time figuring out what it is I want to do with my life and I think that could be valuable for anyone else who is struggling to figure out their life's purpose. Right now I am waiting to hear back on whether or not I will be offered a job from a start up near Indianapolis. I've found one of the best ways for me to figure out what I like is just to take action to try have as many experiences as I can and figure out what I like from there. Step one in finding your life's purpose: figure out what you like and what you do not like.
		  <h3> 12/15/2022</h3> 
		  <p> Yes! I finally got my website to publish. Now, all I need to do is figure out how to get my photos to show up and I'll be up and running. I can't believe I got it to work. Let's go!
            <h3>12/13/2022 </h3>
		<p> I'm going to keep this one brief. I tried publishing my website publically today. It took too much effort for today. I want this to be a fun project, so I decided to stop. Soon, I will figure it out. Soon, I plan to learn about CSS. Just HTML works for now. I'm also going to start taking more pictures for this, I think.
	    <h3> 12/12/2022 </h3>
		<p> Well, I'm testing out this whole writing on the internet thing. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. I'm searching for a job and I recently was offered one. I want a different one that I recently got an interview for, but I havent gotten a job offer from them yet. That feels like an extremely entitled thing to say. Today, I rejected my first job offer. Only time will tell how that decision will work out. This doesn't work as well as I thought it would. I'm not really sure what all to add to this site either. It's just fun to try out all kinds of different stuff.</p>
